## Competitive Landscape Analysis

### Vercel's Current Pricing (2025)

| Plan | Price | Key Features |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Hobby** | Free | Personal projects only, limited bandwidth, no commercial use |
| **Pro** | $20/user/month | 1TB bandwidth, 10M edge requests, team collaboration |
| **Enterprise** | ~$20,000-$25,000/year | SSO, SLA, custom limits, dedicated support |

**Key Vercel Pain Points (Our Opportunity):**

| **Railway** | Full-stack, built-in DBs | Overkill for static sites, credit-based |
| **Render** | Predictable pricing, versatile | Cold starts, fewer advanced features |

2. **GCP-Based Cost Efficiency** - Cloud Run's pay-per-use model
